Use "Path pattern" and "Project pattern" to specify the target page.  
If neither is set, all pages will be targeted.

"Path pattern" is a regular expression to specify the page path.  
If a path pattern was set, the code will not be inserted if the path of the page do not match.

The following is an example.
* `/issues$` : Issue list
* `/issues/[0-9]+` : Issue detail page

"Project pattern" is a regular expression to specify the project identifier. It becomes item added in v2.7.0.  
If the project pattern was set, the code will not be inserted if the current project do not match.

"Insertion position" is the code insertion position. It becomes item added in v1.2.0.

* "Head of all pages" (The same position as the version before v1.2.0)
* "Bottom of issue form"<br>
Issue input fields are reconstructed when trackers or statuses are changed. If "Bottom of issue form" is specified, it will be executed again when reconstructed.
* "Bottom of issue detail"
* "Bottom of all pages" (Last in HTML body)
* "Issues context menu"

If there is no part corresponding to the insertion position of the code on the page, the code is not insert.
For example, even if there are no "Path pattern" and "Project pattern" settings and all pages are targeted, if "Bottom of issue detail" is specified for "Insertion position", it will be executed only on the issue detail page.

In "Type", select the type of code ("JavaScript", "CSS" or "HTML") and enter the actual code in "Code".

For "Comment" you can put an overview on customization. The contents entered here are displayed in the list display.
When "Comment" is entered, "Comment" is displayed on the list.
If "Comment" is not entered, "Code" is displayed in the list.

Addition is completed by clicking "Create" button.

On the page that matches the "Path pattern" and "Project pattern", the code will be embedded at the position specified in "Insertion position", and the page will be customized.

If you check the operation with "Private" and there is no problem in operation, it will be good to release it to the all.

### ViewCustomize.context (JavaScript)

You can access information on users and projects using `ViewCustomize.context`.

`ViewCustomize.context` is as follows.

```javascript
ViewCustomize = {
  "context": {
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "login": "admin",
      "admin": true,
      "firstname": "Redmine",
      "lastname": "Admin",
      "mail": "admin@example.com",
      "lastLoginOn": "2019-09-22T14:44:53Z",
      "groups": [
        {"id": 5, "name": "Group1"}
      ],
      "apiKey": "3dd35b5ad8456d90d21ef882f7aea651d367a9d8",
      "customFields": [
        {"id": 1, "name": "[Custom field] Text", "value": "text"},
        {"id": 2, "name": "[Custom field] List", "value": ["B", "A"]},
        {"id": 3, "name": "[Custom field] Boolean", "value": "1"}
      ]
    },
    "project": {
      "id": 1,
      "identifier": "project-a",
      "name": "Project A",
      "roles": [
        {"id": 6, "name": "RoleX"}
      ],
      "customFields": [
        {"id": 4, "name": "[Project Custom field] Text", "value": "text"}
      ]
    },
    "issue": {
      "id": 1,
      "author": {"id": 2, "name": "John Smith"},
      "totalEstimatedHours": 10.0,
      "totalSpentHours": 11.5,
      "lastUpdatedBy": {"id": 1, "name": "Redmine Admin"}
    }
  }
}
```

For example, to access the user's API access key is `ViewCustomize.context.user.apiKey`.

### API access key

The API access key is created when the "Show" link of the API access key on the My account page is click for the first time.

![Screenshot of my account](screenshots/my_account.en.png)

If you want to created it automatically, set "Automatically create API access key" to ON in the plugin configure page. API access keys can be created without having each user operate the My account page.

To use the API access key, "Enable REST web service" must be turned on in the "API" tab of the setting page.
